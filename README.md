# Binding of Isaac Vertical slice

This project was my vertical slice project with a twist.
We needed to remake 10 seconds of the game only with your own twist,
our twist was our own boss.

## Features

- [Boss Behaviour](https://github.com/FloydMa1/BOI-vertical/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Enemy)

## Software Anaylse 
We wanted to make this project in unity because we had the most experience with it and
because we had not much time.

What i wanted to learn making this project
- Good and functional boss
